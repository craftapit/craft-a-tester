# TestRunner Integration Tests

This set of tests verifies the functionality of the TestRunner for running test stories.

## Scenario: TestRunner Creation and Configuration

In this scenario, we'll test creating and configuring a TestRunner with various options.

### Steps

1. Create a TestRunner with default configuration
2. Create a TestRunner with custom LLM adapter
3. Create a TestRunner with multiple adapters and addons
4. Verify the runner initializes all adapters correctly
5. Test configuration of caching options

### Expected Results

- The TestRunner should be created with default configuration
- Custom LLM adapters should be properly configured
- Additional adapters and addons should be registered
- All adapters should be initialized during runner initialization
- Caching options should be respected

## Scenario: Running Tests with TestRunner

In this scenario, we'll test running test stories with the TestRunner.

### Steps

1. Create a TestRunner with appropriate configuration
2. Run a simple test scenario from a string
3. Verify the test results are correct
4. Run a test from a file
5. Run multiple tests from a directory
6. Verify the test summary is accurate

### Expected Results

- The TestRunner should execute test scenarios correctly
- Test results should include step status information
- TestRunner should be able to load tests from files
- TestRunner should be able to run multiple tests from a directory
- Test summaries should accurately reflect test results
